   First, running the `code_preprocess_1d` code in the `Data_Preprocess` folder will generate the model's inputs (infrared channels and COT, all in 128*128 shape) and basic properties of the 1-degree grid cloud scenes. 
   The files starting with `func_` are the functions that need to be used.
   The H5 file is an example of the output generated by the `code_preprocess_1d` script. (Without condition filtering.)
   

2. [python]
   Secondly, use the `judge` code in the `Model_Judge` folder to call the model parameters (`64epochs_accuracy0.91456.pth`) to classify cloud scenes.
   The `mytorchutils` code contains some custom functions needed by the `judge` code.
   The outputs of `judge` are NPZ files containing 'cats' and 'certs' arrays. (Without condition filtering.)

3. The outputs of `judge` and `code_preprocess_1d` together form our product, from which the portion of marine low clouds that meet the criteria is selected.
